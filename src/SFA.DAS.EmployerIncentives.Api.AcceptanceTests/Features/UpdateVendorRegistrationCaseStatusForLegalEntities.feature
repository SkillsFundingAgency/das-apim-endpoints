Feature: UpdateVendorRegistrationCaseStatusForLegalEntities
	In order for Incentive Application to progress
	As an employer
	I want VRF case status to be updated

Scenario: A VRF case status update job is triggered
	When Refresh Vendor Registration Form Status is invoked
	Then latest VRF cases are retrieved from Finance API
	And VRF case details are updated for legal entities
	And VRF vendor ids are retrieved from the Finance API for legal entities that are unpopulated
